            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>         
                4¼ cups water <br>
                2 cups pork spare rib cut into chunks <br>
                1 pc red onion, quartered <br>
                2 pcs medium sized tomato, quartered <br>
                8 pcs sitaw, sliced into 2” pieces <br>
                250 g kangkong stalk and leaves <br>
                1 pc talong, sliced <br>
                2 pcs siling pangsigang <br>
                1 (20g) pack Knorr Sinigang sa Sampalok Mix Original <br>
                Optional: labanos, okra <br>
            </p>
            <h2>Cooking Procedure</h2>
            <p>
                1. Begin by washing pork spare ribs in cold running water to remove any visible impurities. Then, place pork ribs submerge in a medium pot with a liter of water. Bring to a boil without covering the pot and allow the scum to float to the surface. Meticulously remove the scums from the surface of the water using a slotted spoon or a spatula. Scums are impurities found in meat. <br>
                2. After the broth clears up, turn you heat to medium setting, then it’s time toss in your onions and tomatoes to add flavor to the broth. Cover your pot and let it simmer to fully cook your meat. Use a fork to pierce the meat so that the flavors would also enter the meaty parts of the spare ribs, You also do this so you can tell if it’s already set and tender. <br>
                3. You can already add your vegetables. Start by adding the sitaw, kangkong stalks and talong into the pot and cook until these turn dark green. If you decide to use labanos and okra, you can also add those at this point. This should take roughly around 2-3 minutes. <br>
                4. Add in your siling sigang, kangkong leaves and the Knorr Sinigang sa Sampaloc Mix. Stir and let it simmer. It should be done in about 2-3 minutes. <br>
                5. All done! Transfer your Sinigang to a serving bowl. This is a happy treat that warms, soothes and satisfies everyone in the family! Remember to prepare extra servings of rice to enjoy the extra asim kilig taste of this Filipino classic soup. Enjoy! <br>

                1 -1.5 kilogram oxtail, cut ups <br>
                2 pcs onions, quartered <br>
                water, enough to cover meat <br>
                4 tbsp canola oil <br>
                2 tbsp annatto seeds /achuete seeds <br>
                1 pc onion, chopped <br>
                10 cloves garlic, chopped <br>
                1/2 cup creamy or unsweetened peanut butter <br>
                2 pcs Knorr Beef Cubes <br>
                3 pcs eggplants, sliced <br>
                1 bundle sitaw, cut into 2" pieces <br>

                Other vegetables to include: Pumpking flowers, spinach <br>
            </p>
            <h2>Cooking Procedure</h2>
            <p>
                1. First, you need to tenderize the oxtail to be able to enjoy this majestic dish. Get a pot and throw in the oxtail and quartered onions in. Pour the water and just boil over high heat then reduce to a simmer until oxtail is tender. Once tender, strain the oxtail from the broth and set aside the meat and broth. <br>
                2. Now, get a pan and combine the oil and annatto seeds together. Cook over low heat for 3 minutes or until the color of the oil turn orange. Strain out the seeds then pour the infused oil back into the pan. Throw in the onions and garlic and saute until lightly toasted. Add the softened oxtail next and continue to saute. <br>
                3. Just a few more steps and this dish is done. Add the peanut butter, 1-1/2 cups of broth (where oxtail was softened) and Knorr Beef Cubes. Mix well until peanut butter is dissolved. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until sauce has slightly thickened. <br>
                4.Now, add the vegetables last and cook until done. That's it! Classic Kare Kare is best enjoyed with a serving of warm bagoong. We kid you not, you will definitely eat more than usual. It's sooo delicious! <br>
